# Sentiment Analysis of Customer Reviews - ML approach

This project analyzes multiple reviews from users and categorizes reviews as positive or negative based on sentiment scores. The sentiment scoring or polarity measure is found using NLTK's VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning) library. Using this sentiment scoring, we generate labels for each text input, where a score between 0-1 is positive or '1' and score less than 0 is negative '-1'. 

I used a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier since it works really well for smaller datasets and is really fast. My model achieved a 100% accuracy and worked well during prediction. This project was a great way to implement web-scraping techniques and also practice SQL coding to manage datasets.
